Have you ever received a scam email asking you to download a pdf by clicking the link and when you pressed that link they asked you to "sign in" with your email credentials?
It's time to destroy those scammers.
Step 1: generate a csv with as many fake credentials (name, surname, email and password) you want.
Step 2: enter the endpoint where the POST request is being sent, add the username and password payload object names and let the programme send the requests.
Result: the scammer's database is filled with fake emails and passwords making it unusable.
